Answer 1: In the described database, "Product" and "Product_Category" are linked through a one-to-many relationship, with "Product" containing a `category_id` that references the "Product_Category" `id`. This setup means each product is assigned to a single category, but each category can include numerous products. This relationship is crucial for organizing products in a manageable, hierarchical structure, facilitating easy data retrieval for category-based queries, and ensuring each product is uniquely categorized, enhancing data integrity and query efficiency in the system.

Answer 2: To ensure each product in the "Product" table has a valid category, you can use a foreign key constraint. In the "Product" table, the `category_id` should be a foreign key that connects to the `id` in the "Product_Category" table. This means every product must have a `category_id` that matches an existing category in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that each product is associated with a valid category. Additionally, set the foreign key to CASCADE on delete or update, so if a category is deleted or its ID changes, it will automatically be updated in the "Product" table to maintain consistency.
